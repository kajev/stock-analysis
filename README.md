# Stock-Analysis 

## Overview of This Analysis
The objective is to observe the trends of the stock market and see what stocks gain or lose value. We also want to optimize the code so we can run it on larger datasets. When working with stocks, we can easily expand our data with all that is available. 

## Results

In 2017 most of the stocks we were interested in did well with the exception of the TERP stock. The stocks DQ and SEDG were the top performing stocks of this year.

###### 2018 Results
![alt text](https://github.com/kajev/stock-analysis/blob/main/2018.png)
2018 was a bad year for almost all the stocks on this list. Only RUN and ENPH had positive turnout rates. 
If we were considering what stock that seems to be the most consistent over both years then ENPH would be the front runner. It was third in 2017 and first in 2018, making a big profit to all its shareholders.

## Final Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is the code will look more organized and will make more sense to you. The disadvantages are that you may miss some bugs that your old tests may not be able to catch.
Advantages of the original code include passing all preliminary tests we might have for it. The disadvantages for the original include lack of flexibility and some hard coding here and there. The disadvantages of the refactored script are the advantages of the original, vice versa( adv of refactored is the disadv of original).
